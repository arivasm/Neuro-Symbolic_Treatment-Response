# Neuro-Symbolic_Treatment-Response

We present a novel approach based on the integration of Neuro-Symbolic AI systems. The symbolic system is implemented by deductive databases, enhancing the predictive capacity of subsymbolic systems implemented as Knowledge Graph Embedding models. As a proof of concept, we assess the performance of the proposed neuro-symbolic system on top of a KG of lung cancer treatments; the predictive task is to predict treatment effectiveness. The deductive database that specifies the rules relies on our previous work, [“Capturing Knowledge about Drug-Drug Interactions to Enhance Treatment Effectiveness”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460210.3493560), where we propose a deductive system over knowledge graphs to formalize the process of pharmacokinetic DDIs.
